\section{Methodology}
    
    \paragraph{}
    Our research delves into "Optimal scheduling for energy-harvesting batteryless sensory systems" highlighting key concepts like "Energy-Harvesting," "Batteryless," and "Scheduling." Our initial broad search scope was refined by incorporating terms such as "MEMS," "IoT," "Intermittent," and "Ultra Low Power" to closely align with our objectives of promoting "Energy Efficiency" and "Green IT."

    \paragraph{}
    Upon selecting publications based on relevance, citation count, and recency, we conducted further analysis by exploring additional works by the same authors and cross-verifying the gathered data to ensure accuracy.

    \paragraph{}
    This meticulous search strategy shaped our research framework, necessitating precise searches to enrich each section of our review. We predominantly sourced information from IEEExplorer, ACM Digital Library, ResearchGate, and Google Scholar, with selective contributions from DirectScience and Springer, to compile essential insights.
