abstract="In the development of the modern society, one of the key factors is to save energy in order to become more independent of other energy resources. Two important approaches can be taken---one is to change behavior and thereby save energy---the second one is to develop new technology which is able to save energy in different applications. This chapter will give an overview of challenges and possibilities in terms of energy saving and also energy efficient use. This includes a discussion on high efficiency power electronics devices and the systems they are used for energy loss reduction. The key enabling technologies are power electronics, Information and Communication Technology (ICT) as well as systems to carry the electrical energy through power transmission, conversion and distribution. A couple of examples will be given to demonstrate the energy saving possibilities by power electronics systems, such as in the applications of adjustable speed drives and solid-state lighting systems. Power electronics gives also a high flexibility when renewable power production is introduced to electrical energy systems. Future research opportunities and challenges will finally be discussed.",

    abstract = {In this paper, we identify and address the problems of designing effective power management schemes in low-power MCU design. Firstly, this paper proposes an application-based multipower domain architecture along with a variety of working modes to effectively realize the hierarchical control of power consumption. Furthermore, devices in energy IoT (eIoT) do not always work under the main power supply. When the main power supply is unavailable, the standby power supply (usually the battery) needs to maintain the operation and save the data. In order to ensure the complete isolation between these two power sources, it is always necessary to insert a diode in both select-conduction paths, respectively. In this paper, we built a stable and smooth power switching circuit into the chip, which can effectively avoid the diode voltage loss and reduce the BoM cost. In addition, in the sleep mode, considering the relaxed output voltage range and a limited driving capability requirement, an ultra-low-power standby power circuit is proposed, which can autonomously replace the internal LDO when in sleep, further reducing the sleep power consumption under the main power supply.}

ABSTRACT = {This paper provides a short review of sustainable hybrid energy harvesting and its applications. The potential usage of self-powered wireless sensor (WSN) systems has recently drawn a lot of attention to sustainable energy harvesting. The objective of this research is to determine the potential of hybrid energy harvesters to help single energy harvesters overcome their energy deficiency problems. The major findings of the study demonstrate how hybrid energy harvesting, which integrates various energy conversion technologies, may increase power outputs, and improve space utilization efficiency. Hybrid energy harvesting involves collecting energy from multiple sources and converting it into electrical energy using various transduction mechanisms. By properly integrating different energy conversion technologies, hybridization can significantly increase power outputs and improve space utilization efficiency. Here, we present a review of recent progress in hybrid energy-harvesting systems for sustainable green energy harvesting and their applications in different fields. This paper starts with an introduction to hybrid energy harvesting, showing different hybrid energy harvester configurations, i.e., the integration of piezoelectric and electromagnetic energy harvesters; the integration of piezoelectric and triboelectric energy harvesters; the integration of piezoelectric, triboelectric, and electromagnetic energy harvesters; and others. The output performance of common hybrid systems that are reported in the literature is also outlined in this review. Afterwards, various potential applications of hybrid energy harvesting are discussed, showing the practical attainability of the technology. Finally, this paper concludes by making recommendations for future research to overcome the difficulties in developing hybrid energy harvesters. The recommendations revolve around improving energy conversion efficiency, developing advanced integration techniques, and investigating new hybrid configurations. Overall, this study offers insightful information on sustainable hybrid energy harvesting together with quantitative information, numerical findings, and useful research recommendations that progress and promote the use of this technology.},

However, a state-of-the-art review is lacking on advanced controls for SEE buildings, especially considering advanced building energy systems, machine learning based advanced controls, and advanced occupant-centric controls (OCC). This study presents a comprehensive review on the latest advancement of advanced controls for SEE buildings, which covers recent research on data collection through smart metering and sensors, big data and building automation, energy digitization, and building energy simulation. Machine learning based advanced controls are comprehensively reviewed, including supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning, together with their roles and underlying mechanisms. In addition, advanced controls for energy security, reliability, robustness, flexibility, and resilience are further reviewed for energy-efficient and low-carbon buildings, with respect to fault detection and diagnosis, fire alarming and building energy safety, and climate change adaptation. Moreover, this study explores the advanced OCC systems and their applications in SEE buildings. Last but not the least, this study emphasizes the challenges and future prospects of the trade-off between complexity and predictive/control performance, AI-based controllers and climate change adaptation, OCC in thermal comfort and energy saving for the SEE buildings. This study offers valuable insights into the latest research progress concerning the underlying mechanisms, algorithms and applications of advanced controls for SEE buildings, paving the path for sustainable and low-carbon transition in building sectors.}

Our design implements a power failure resilient Nintendo Game Boy emulator that can run off-the-shelf classic Game Boy games like Tetris or Super Mario Land. This emulator is capable of intermittent operation by tracking memory usage, avoiding the need for always checkpointing all volatile memory, and decouples the game loop from user interface mechanics allowing for restoration after power failure. We build custom hardware that harvests energy from gamer button presses and sunlight, and leverages a mixed volatility memory architecture for efficient intermittent emulation of game binaries. Beyond a fun toy, our design represents the first battery-free system design for continuous user attention despite frequent power failures caused by intermittent energy harvesting. We tackle key challenges in intermittent computing for interaction including seamless displays and dynamic incentive-based gameplay for energy harvesting. This work provides a reference implementation and framework for a future of battery-free mobile gaming in a more sustainable Internet of Things.},

abstract = {Battery-free sensing devices harvest energy from their surrounding environment to perform sensing, computation, and communication. This enables previously impossible applications in the Internet-of-Things. A core challenge for these devices is maintaining usefulness despite erratic, random or irregular energy availability; which causes inconsistent execution, loss of service and power failures. Adapting execution (degrading or upgrading) seems promising as a way to stave off power failures, meet deadlines, or increase throughput. However, because of constrained resources and limited local information, it is a challenge to decide when would be the best time to adapt, and how exactly to adapt execution. In this paper, we systematically explore the fundamental mechanisms of energy-aware adaptation, and propose heuristic adaptation as a method for modulating the performance of tasks to enable higher sensor coverage, completion rates, or throughput, depending on the application. We build a task based adaptive runtime system for intermittently powered sensors embodying this concept. We complement this runtime with a user facing simulator that enables programmers to conceptualize the tradeoffs they make when choosing what tasks to adapt, and how, relative to real world energy harvesting environment traces. While we target battery-free, intermittently powered sensors, we see general application to all energy harvesting devices. We explore heuristic adaptation with varied energy harvesting modalities and diverse applications: machine learning, activity recognition, and greenhouse monitoring, and find that the adaptive version of our ML app performs up to 46\% more classifications with only a 5\% drop in accuracy; the activity recognition app captures 76\% more classifications with only nominal down-sampling; and find that heuristic adaptation leads to higher throughput versus non-adaptive in all cases.},

abstract = {With the advent of Tiny Machine Learning (tinyML), it is increasingly feasible to deploy optimized ML models on constrained battery-less Internet of Things (IoT) devices with minimal energy availability. Due to the unpredictable and dynamic harvesting environment, successfully running tinyML on battery-less devices is still challenging. In this paper, we present the energy-aware deployment and management of tinyML algorithms and application tasks on battery-less IoT devices. We study the trade-offs between different inference strategies, analyzing under which circumstances it is better to make the decision locally or send the data to the Cloud where the heavy-weight ML model is deployed, respecting energy, accuracy, and time constraints. To decide which of these two options is more optimal and can satisfy all constraints, we define an energy-aware tinyML optimization algorithm. Our approach is evaluated based on real experiments with a prototype for battery-less person detection, which considers two different environments: (i) a controllable setup with artificial light, and (ii) a dynamic harvesting environment based on natural light. Our results show that the local inference strategy performs best in terms of execution speed when a controllable harvesting environment is considered. It can execute 3 times as frequently as remote inference at a harvesting current of 2 mA and using a capacitor of 1.5 F. In a realistic harvesting scenario with natural light and making use of the energy-aware optimization algorithm, the device will favor remote inference under high light conditions due to the better accuracy of the Cloud-based model. Otherwise, it switches to local inference.}

Our contributions include a definition of CRFIDs, a framework for energy management in CRFIDs, and the preliminary design of Mementos, a medley of compile-time and run-time techniques to achieve effective forward progress of computation on CRFIDs by using energy-aware computational checkpoints and voltage-aware program reordering that maintains program semantics. Our preliminary measurements indicate that Mementos will enable CRFIDs to complete long-running computations despite constant interruptions to power.},

    abstract={The collaborative Internet of Things (C-IoT) is an emerging paradigm that involves many communities with the idea of cooperating in data gathering and service sharing. Many fields of application, such as smart cities and environmental monitoring, use the concept of crowdsensing in order to produce the amount of data that such Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios need in order to be pervasive. In this paper we introduce an architecture, namely SenSquare, able to handle both the heterogeneous data sources coming from open IoT platform and crowdsensing campaigns, and display a unified access to users. We inspect all the facets of such a complex system, spanning over issues of different nature: we deal with heterogeneous data classification, mobile crowdsensing management for environmental data, information representation, and unification, IoT service composition and deployment. We detail our proposed solution in dealing with such tasks and present possible methods for meeting open challenges. Finally, we demonstrate the capabilities of SenSquare through both a mobile and a desktop client.},

  abstract={The imprecise computation technique has been proposed as a way to handle transient overload and to enhance fault tolerance of real-time systems. In a system based on this technique, each time-critical task is designed in such a way that it can produce a usable, approximate result in time whenever a failure or overload prevents it from producing the desired, precise result. This paper describes ways to implement imprecise computations, models to characterize them and algorithms for scheduling them. An imprecise mechanism for the generation and use of approximate results can be integrated in a natural way with a traditional fault-tolerance mechanism. An architectural framework for this integration is described.<>},

abstract = {Background activities on mobile devices can cause significant battery drain with little visibility or recourse to the user. They can range from useful but sometimes overly aggressive tasks, such as polling for messages or updates from sensors and online services, to outright bugs that cause resources to be held unnecessarily. In this paper we instrument the Android OS to characterize background activities that prevent the device from sleeping. We present TAMER, an OS mechanism that interposes on events and signals that cause task wakeups, and allows for their detailed monitoring, filtering, and rate-limiting. We demonstrate how TAMER can help reduce battery drain in scenarios involving popular Android apps with background tasks. We also show how TAMER can mitigate the effects of well-known energy bugs while maintaining most of the apps' functionality. Finally, we elaborate on how developers and users can devise their own application-control policies for TAMER to maximize battery lifetime.},
